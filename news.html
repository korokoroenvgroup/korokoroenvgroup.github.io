<h2>Working Bee at Korokoro Stream</h2>
<em>Sunday, September 30th 2018</em>

<p>
We're planning another working bee for 30th at Inanga Love Park on the banks
of the lower reaches of the Korokoro Stream.  <a href="contact.html">Contact
Daniel</a> if you're interested.
</p>

<h2>Great Kereru Count</h2>
<em>September 21st-30th 2018</em>

<p>
The Great Kererū Count is NZ’s biggest citizen science project to help gather information on the abundance and distribution of the New Zealand pigeon — also known as kererū, kūkū or kūkupa.
</p>

<p>
Everyone in New Zealand can get involved with the Great Kererū Count, whether you see any kererū or not, sharing your observations will help build up a clearer picture of where the kererū live, how many there are and what they are feeding on.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://www.greatkererucount.nz/">www.greatkererucount.nz</a>
for details.
</p>

<h2>Petone Railway Corridor Clean Up</h2>
<em>Sunday, September 23rd 2018</em>

<p>
There's a clean up day for the railway corridor in Petone on the 23rd.
Details to follow.
</p>

<h2>Hutt Valley-Wellington Whaitua Committee</h2>
<em>August, 2018</em>

<p>
GWRC are now recruiting community members for the Hutt Valley-Wellington
Whaitua Committee. Their website describes the remit of the committee in the
following terms:
</p>

<blockquote>
The Hutt Valley-Wellington Whaitua Committee, will be a group of local people
tasked with researching and recommending tailored solutions for water issues in
the catchment. Encompassing Hutt Valley, Makara, Wainuiomata, and Wellington
City, the catchment is large and home to diverse communities with unique
relationships to water. The committee will need public input to ensure the
solutions they develop are going to work for our environment and all of those
who call the whaitua home.
</blockquote>

<p>
So if you or someone you know who is passionate about safeguarding and
restoring our waterways you may want to consider applying. There is plenty of
information about what being a committee member would involve on the GWRC
website. However, if you would like more of a personal perspective then contact
Daniel who can put you in touch with a member of the Porirua Committee, which
has been up and running for a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="http://www.gw.govt.nz/hutt-valley-wellington-harbour-whaitua/">the
GWRC website</a> for details of how to apply.
Applications close 4th September.
</p>

Many thanks to those who came and helped at our working bee.  We did a lot of
weeding and some planting. The following weekend our friends from the Growing
Places Trust went back and did some more planting.
</p>

<p>
We now need to plan a further working bee to paint the new mural, weed
further and plant the additional plants that the Council are providing.
After that we will have to sort out a regular schedule of light management in
order to keep the weeds at bay.

<h2>154 Bus Service</h2>
<em>July, 2018</em>
<p>
Korokoro now has a bus service on Saturdays!  The <a
href="https://www.metlink.org.nz/timetables/bus/154">154 bus service</a>
now runs 12 times on Saturday at hourly intervals.
</p>

<img src="images/154.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="154 bus">

<p>
Some handy 154 tips:

<ul>
<li> Most 154 services are timed to connect at Petone station with trains both to and from Wellington
<li> Pay by Snapper and transfer to the 154 from another bus anywhere on its route and your ride up the hill is free (because the 154's route is all in fare zone 4 - even for the services which go to Lower Hutt on school days)
<li> The last bus up the hill on weekdays is now at 6:31pm which means it is free is you have a SuperGold card (the last bus on Saturday at 6:55pm is too!)
</ul>

<h2>KEG Meeting</h2>
<em>1st July, 2018</em>
<p>
A KEG meeting was held on Sunday 1st July.
Read the <a href="images/KEG - minutes of meeting 01.07.17.pdf">minutes</a>
for details of what was discussed.

<h2>Hutt City Council Long Term Plan</h2>
<em>May 2018</em>
<p>
Hutt City recently ran a consultation on its Long Term Plan for 2018–2028.
Julie presented <a href="images/KEG submission long term plan.pdf">our submissions</a>
to the Mayor and Councillors at a public meeting in the Council Chambers on
16th May 2018.
</p>

<h2>School garden</h2>
<em>May 2018</em>
<p>
Thanks to the team of volunteers who have been helping to get the school garden
in order. We held a working bee in late May to do some work on the new beds and
put up a shade-house.
</p>

<h2>Second working bee at Korokoro Stream</h2>
<em>May 2018</em>
<p>
Thanks for all those who have volunteered for this second working bee on the
stream. A slight delay in sourcing new plants has meant that we have put this
off until early June.
</p>

<h2>May pest monitoring</h2>
<em>May 2018</em>
<p>
Paul will be out this weekend with the team of volunteers, helping monitor
mustelid, rodent and hedgehog numbers in Korokoro Valley.  GWRC’s reports on
the May pest monitoring in the region’s Key Native Ecosystems will go on up on
the website when it is received.
</p>

<h2>Community Bee Hives in Korokoro</h2>
<em>May 2018</em>
<p>
Lower Hutt Charity, the Common Unity Project, have agreed to come up to
Korokoro in the next couple of weeks to check out a couple of sites to see if
they are suitable for communal bee hives. In the event that they report on
suitable sites we will discuss whether to support the Project and host the
hives at the next KEG meeting.
</p>

    <h2>The latest threat to Korokoro Valley from the Petone-to-Grenada Road</h2>
<em>April 2018</em>
    <p>
Before Christmas the <a href="https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/projects/petone-grenada-link-road/docs/p2g-evaluation-report-sept-2017.pdf">latest NZTA evaluation into the P2G</a> was published. Following the Kaikoura and Wellington earthquakes the
evaluation report looked at resilience and the expected costs, benefits and
environmental impacts. The project evaluation queried the
resilience of the preferred option and suggested that costs would be much
higher than first anticipated. It also highlighted that the environmental
impacts could be difficult to mitigate. The good news is that the evaluation
recommends abandoning the current route; the bad news is it recommends
consideration of discarded options including that of using the Korokoro Valley
as a route.
</p>

<p>
KEG <a href="images/KEG_Minister_Twyford-Jan_201815012018.pdf">wrote to
Minister Twyford in mid January 2018</a>.  We advocated that NZTA be steered
towards more sustainable options, saying that there were good alternative ways
of improving connectivity and calling on the minister to replace the
discredited approach of tackling congestion through increased roading with a
strategy that focusses on intelligent public and haulage transport, improved
facilities for cycling and walking and public planning to reduce car use across
the region.  In early April <a href="images/KEG_Minister_Twyford_reply-03042018103551-0001.pdf">the
Minister responded</a>.
</p>

<p>
We encourage you to actively oppose building a road through the Korokoro Valley.
</p>

<h2>Nets for Recycling Bins</h2>
<em>April 2018</em>

<p>
As we head further into autumn we face the prospect of rubbish being blown all
over Korokoro from open recycling bins. The solution is for as many people as
possible to use the nets which go over the bins.
</p>

<img src="images/full-recycling-box.jpg" width=400 height=302 alt="Full recycling box with net">

<p>
The Council have kindly provided us with lots of nets, at a reduced rate. If
you or your neighbours need any please contact <a
href="mailto:danieldotdot&#x40;hotmail.co&#109;">Daniel Jones</a> and we will
drop some round.  (A contribution of $5 per net to help us cover our costs
would be appreciated).
</p>

<h2>Working Bee at Korokoro Steam</h2>
<em>April 2018</em>

<p>
Volunteers from KEG, with help from the Growing Places charity, spent the
afternoon of Sunday 1st April weeding, planting and tidying at Inanga Love
Park, at the mouth of the Korokoro Stream.
</p>

<img src="images/working-bee-2018-04.jpg" width=400 height=252 alt="Working bee group photo">

<p>
The Inanga Love Park was part of 2016 Common Ground Festival. It involved
restoring the unloved section of the Stream between the culvert and the sea by
removing the rubbish, establishing plant-cover to help spawning native fish and
creating a series of posters about the stream and its ecology.
</p>

<p>
The original plants did not thrive over the long, hot summer and the posters
were starting to look tatty. So, we have cleared some weeds, done some more
planting and taken the posters down.
</p>

<p>
New posters are being created. Once they are ready we will put them up and
continue with the planting.
</p>

<h2>Korokoro School Gala Fair</h2>
<em>March 2018</em>

<p>
KEG had a stall at this year’s school gala to help raise money for the school,
but we also helped reduce the waste created by the gala itself by organising
compost and recycling bins and provide stall holders with suggestions for
reusable/recyclable products and packaging.
</p>

<p>
With plenty of people using the bins and a reduction in the use of plastics and
clingfilm this was a big step in the right direction. It was not ‘zero waste’
but we now have enough know-how to help Home and School run a genuine zero
waste event next time round.
</p>

<h2>Pest Monitoring Report</h2>
<em>February 2018</em>

<p>
Four times each year KEG volunteers check pest monitoring tunnels in the
Korokoro Valley and report results to Greater Wellington Regional Council.
Korokoro Valley has been identified as one of several
<a href="http://www.gw.govt.nz/KNE/">Key Native Ecosystems (KNE)</a>
in the Wellington Region.
</p>

<p>
The Key Native Ecosystem programme aims to protect some of the best examples
of native ecosystems in the Wellington region. It is working to achieve this by
managing, reducing, or removing threats to their values. One of the primary
threats to native plants and animals is introduced mammals, including rats and
mustelids. Control of these pest animals is therefore undertaken at most KNE
sites throughout the region. Regular monitoring is carried out to determine the
effectiveness of these control efforts.
</p>

<p>
The latest pest monitoring event was in February. For Belmont-Korokoro that
showed that rat tracking rates were on target, mice tracking was low, mustelid
tracking was absent, but Hedgehogs were up by 33%. For more details,
